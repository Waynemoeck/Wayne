  <h1> This is the scratch game that we created. To shoot the arrow, press the right arrow key. When you shoot the arrow, the arrow will move quickly to the right until it hits the edge of the screen and then it will go back to where it started. Every time you hit the apple with the arrow you get 5 points and you will move on to the next level. Each level has a different background and a different difficulty. The speed of the apple moving up and down increases after each level is passed. After the game is completed, the background swtiches to the night city background and the screen says Game Over. The game will restart when the green flag is clicked again.  </h1>
