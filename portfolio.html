  <h1> This is the scratch game that we created. To shoot the arrow, press the right arrow key. When you shoot the arrow, the arrow will move quickly to the right until it hits the edge of the screen and then it will go back to where it started. Every time you hit the apple with the arrow you get 5 points and you will move on to the next level. Each level has a different background and a different difficulty. The speed of the apple moving up and down increases after each level is passed. After the game is completed, the background swtiches to the night city background and the screen says Game Over. The game will restart when the green flag is clicked again.  </h1>

      <h1> This is the code that we created with python for our interactive fiction project. We created a short story and then created a flow chart based on the story that showed multiple decisiosn and how the story will progress based on the decisions that were made. Then, we created code for the interactive fiction that included many if else and if elif statements. When the interactive fiction story is run, the user can make multiple decisions throughout the story and the story will change based on the decision made. We also made the code so that if a incorrect input was made then it would not allow them to continue.
